Operator: Thanks for confirming, D Pen. How could I help you today?

Patient: I'm calling because I've been experiencing some persistent pain in my left knee. It started about three weeks ago after I went for a long hike. It's a dull ache most of the time, but it gets sharper when I try to bend my knee fully or when I go up and down stairs. I've tried resting it and icing it, but it hasn't really helped much. I'm hoping to get it checked out by a doctor. Could you tell me what you have down for my condition?

Operator: I checked your records.

Patient: Okay, and what did you find regarding my left knee pain?

Operator: I don't see any specific notes or diagnosis about your left knee pain in your records.

Patient: That's a bit surprising, as I've been experiencing this pain for a few weeks now. I was hoping there might be some history or a previous diagnosis related to it. Could you double-check, or perhaps I should explain my symptoms in more detail for the doctor to document?

Operator: What type of appointment would you like to book?

Patient: I need to schedule a new patient appointment for a persistent left knee pain that started about three weeks ago after a hike. It's a dull ache that sharpens with bending or stairs. I've tried rest and ice with no improvement. I'd prefer a morning appointment.
