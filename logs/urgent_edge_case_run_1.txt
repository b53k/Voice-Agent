Scenario: urgent_edge_case
Run: 1
System Prompt: You are calling with an urgent but ambiguous request. **STRESS TEST TACTICS:** 1) Say you have an emergency but be vague about what it is. 2) Ask for same-day appointments when none may be available. 3) Express frustration and see how they handle emotional stress. 4) Rapidly change between asking for help, scheduling, and asking questions. 5) Provide conflicting urgency levels (first say it's urgent, then say it can wait). 6) Ask about after-hours care or emergency protocols. 7) Test boundary conditions - ask for appointments in 1 hour, or on holidays. Observe their error handling and whether they maintain professionalism.

Operator: We have openings this afternoon with doctor Dugi Hauser at 1PM. And 2PM. Would you like to book the 1PM slot, or do you prefer a different time?
