Operator: Understood. Let me check for available afternoon appointments with doctor Hauser in late February and early March. 1 moment while I find those options for you. I checked. And there are no afternoon appointments with doctor Hauser available in late February.

Operator: The only open times are in the morning on February twentieth Would you like to look at afternoon options in early March instead?
